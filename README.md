# Document classification
Classify documents using Python based on **SVM** and **TF-IDF**.


- Two Python librarys(**Pandas** and **liblinear**) are needed. On Windows, you can download the liblinear library from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#liblinear

- The structures of the data files are:
    - The .data files are formatted "docIdx wordIdx count". 
    - The .label files are simply a list of label id's. 
    - The .map files map from label id's to label names.
- This demo will give the **accuracy** near **81.3991% (6109/7505)**.
